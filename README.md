# Employee-Directory

- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

- The objective of this assignment is to create an Employee Directory with react, by breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render, and the user should be able to sort the table by at least one category and 
filter the users by at least one property.

## Instructions/Demos
