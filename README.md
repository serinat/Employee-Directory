## Employee-Directory

- The objective of this assignment is to create an Employee Directory with react, by breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render, and the user should be able to sort the table by at least one category and 
filter the users by at least one property.
